INFO:root:The paper titled "Gentopia: A collaborative platform for tool-augmented llms" by B Xu, X Liu, H Shen, Z Han, Y Li, M Yue, Z Peng, published in 2023, presents a framework for Augmented Language Models (ALMs). ALMs are large language models that have been empowered with the ability to use tools, transforming them into intelligent agents for real-world interactions. 

The authors argue that most existing frameworks for ALMs are deficient in critical features such as flexible customization, collaborative democratization, and holistic evaluation. To address these deficiencies, they present gentopia, an ALM framework that enables flexible customization of agents through simple configurations and seamlessly integrates various language models and task formats.
